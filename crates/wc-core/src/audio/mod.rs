//! Off-thread audio engine.

//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//!   ┌─────────────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────────────┐
//!   │ Bevy main thread (60 Hz)   │        │ cpal audio thread (kHz)    │
//!   │                             │        │                            │

//! ```
//!
//! Both rings are lock-free (`rtrb`). The audio callback never allocates,
//! locks, or blocks; spec §5.4's real-time-friendly invariant.
//!
//! ## What systems consume
//!
//! - [`state::AudioState`] (`Res<…>`) — current engine status, sample rate,
//!   channel count, volume, mute state. Updated each `PreUpdate` from the
//!   audio→main message ring.
//! - [`ring::AudioCommandSender`] (`NonSendMut<…>`) — write
//!   [`command::AudioCommand`]s to mutate audio-thread state
//!   (`SetMasterVolume`, `SetMuted`). `NonSend` because `rtrb::Producer` is
//!   `Send` but not `Sync`; the resource is main-thread-only by construction.
//! - [`ring::AudioMessageReceiver`] (`NonSendMut<…>`) — raw access for systems
//!   that want low-level events; most systems can ignore this and just read
//!   `AudioState`.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle and home-screen silence
//!
//! The cpal stream is **started in a paused state** by [`engine::start_audio_engine`]:
//! it calls `stream.play()` then immediately `stream.pause()` so the OS device
//! is registered but silent. This is the primary silence guarantee at launch.
//!
//! [`pause_audio_on_home`] (registered on `OnEnter(AppState::Home)`) provides
//! a secondary pause for runtime navigation back to Home after a sketch has run.
//! [`resume_audio_on_sketch`] (registered on `OnExit(AppState::Home)`) resumes
//! the stream when the user navigates into any sketch.
//!
//! ## Default behavior
//!
//! With no sketches loaded, the audio engine runs silently — [`dsp::DspHost`]
//! defaults to a graph that emits zeros. Sketches in Plan 6+ will add their
//! own DSP graphs via `AudioCommand::AddSynth` (added when needed).

/// Single plugin that wires the audio engine into the Bevy [`App`].
///
/// Registered by [`crate::CorePlugin`]. On `Startup`, builds the cpal stream,
/// spawns the DSP host, and installs the `Res<AudioCommandSender>` and
/// `Res<AudioMessageReceiver>` resources. On `PreUpdate`, drains the message
/// ring into `Res<AudioState>`. On `OnExit`, the `AudioStream` non-send
/// resource is dropped, which stops the cpal stream.
///
/// The cpal stream is paused while `AppState::Home` is active and resumed when
/// transitioning into any sketch state.
///
/// ## The third thread
///
/// Besides the main thread and cpal's audio thread, `Startup` also spawns the
/// **device-watcher** OS thread ([`device::spawn_device_watcher`]). cpal's device
/// enumeration can block (WASAPI especially), so it may sit on neither of the
/// other two. The watcher polls output-device topology every ~2 s and sends a
/// name snapshot — only when the list actually changed — down an `mpsc` channel;
/// [`device::drain_device_topology`] (`PreUpdate`, main thread) moves the newest
/// one into `AvailableAudioDevices` and asks [`supervisor::AudioSupervisor`] for
/// an immediate reconnect when the saved endpoint reappears. It is the thing that
/// notices the TV came back.
